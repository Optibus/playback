## Contributor License Agreement

Before you can submit any code we need all contributors to sign a
contributor license agreement. By signing a contributor license
agreement (CLA) you're basically just attesting to the fact
that you are the author of the contribution and that you're freely
contributing it under the terms of the CLA.

When you contribute to the Optibus Playback Project with a new pull request,
a bot will evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the
bot will comment on the pull request, including a link to accept the
agreement. The [individual CLA](https://www.optibus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Contribution-License-Agreement-Optibus-1.pdf)
document is available for review as a PDF.

**Note**:
> If your contribution is part of your employment or your contribution is the property of your employer, then you will likely need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://www.optibus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Contribution-License-Agreement-Corporate-Optibus.pdf) too and email it to us at opensource@optibus.com
.
